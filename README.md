# mangyaWAF
A machine learning based web application firewall: The purpose of this project is to investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques for intrusion detection on an application level. The algorithms to be tested are classifiers trained on HTTP payload data which will take a payload as input and decide whether the input contained malicious code or not. WAF will protect from XSS,SQL etc.
